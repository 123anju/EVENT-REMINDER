"# EVENT-REMINDER" 
FullCalendar is great for displaying events, but it isn't a complete solution for event content-management. Beyond dragging an event to a different time/day, you cannot change an event's name or other associated data. It is up to you to add this functionality through FullCalendar's event hooks.
First of all I was intergrate the  full calender into the my nodejs application using jquery.
        <script src='http://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-2.1.1/lib/moment.min.js'></script>
        <script src='http://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-2.1.1/lib/jquery.min.js'></script>
        <script src="http://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-2.1.1/lib/jquery-ui.custom.min.js"></script>
        <script src='http://fullcalendar.io/js/fullcalendar-2.1.1/fullcalendar.min.js'></script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
after that to handle this I was write some code to handle the event as a reminder.
